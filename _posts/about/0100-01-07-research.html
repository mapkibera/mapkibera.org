<div class="methods">

Map Kibera has had the privilege of working with progressive researchers of all levels of experience. Our core principle is that residents of slums like Kibera should directly access, generate and benefit from information produced in their community. For research, this boils down to

<ul>
<li>Design in Partnership
<li>Contribute concretely to the research subject
<li>Complement ongoing projects and schedule
<li>Avoid Survey Fatigue
<li>Publish data and results open access
</ul>

Subject: RE: my research


I have already shared it with my network and channels, also in Open Street Map italian community!
But, of course, I will keep doing it :)

Anyway, I did not know that many italians were interested in Map Kibera! Good to know.
 You find attached two Stefano Marras works (you should know him).

Then I just found these papers on internet, but we don't have a free access for them (I wrote them to give me a free copy):

https://www.francoangeli.it/riviste/Scheda_Rivista.aspx?IDArticolo=45610&Tipo=Articolo%20PDF&lingua=it&idRivista=63 (by Stefano Marras again)

https://www.francoangeli.it/riviste/Scheda_Rivista.aspx?IDArticolo=45610&Tipo=Articolo%20PDF&lingua=it&idRivista=63 (by a lady called Beatrice De Carli, I just knew she works in a Department of Architecture in Milan)
