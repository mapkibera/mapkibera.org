<h3>Map Kibera works with a refined and impact-oriented methodology and theory of change in the Kenyan context. The objective of the organization is to use information to support community goals in our locations of operation. This means having a clear outline of how this will happen.</h3>

# Improving and Advancing our core work in Nairobi’s slums

Serving marginalized communities as a local information and media source, on an ongoing basis. Amplifying the voices of the community. 
<p/>
This is part of Map Kibera Trust's process and service since our start in 2009, and what we are best known and relied upon for.
 

*  Using our media resources, including online video, blogging, and reporting on the Ushahidi “Voice” platforms, our participants and members provide a needed local news service in the communities allowing the local perspective to be showcased online.
*  Our mapping teams map local amenities and resources and update the map so that data about each operational location is current. Sharing that information widely within the community, offline, and online using OpenStreetMap.org.
*  Sharing our offline and online resources widely within Kibera using targeted outreach approaches, and throughout Nairobi, Kenya, and the world. Engaging community members to feed back information and news. 


# Impact and Advocacy: The Engagement Model

Building on our core work to generate specific local impact in Nairobi and deepen engagement. Issue-focused advocacy using multiple types of information and technologies. Forming local networks, building relationships among disparate groups within and across the slums.


## Step One: Initial Mobilization


* Engage with community members who are part of informal or very grassroots groups, such as women's groups, savings groups and other local networks. These community members have key issues that they are primarily concerned with locally. They will determine the key focus area for a long-term campaign.
* Repeat the process in the other locations of operation: (currently, Kibera, Mathare and Mukuru - potential to expand within the city) and create a joint campaign, depending on whether the concerns in the target issue are shared across the slums.
* Meet with network of local service providers, NGOs and other groups that are focused on the issues area chosen. Creation of a network or consortium including Map Kibera Trust and these organizations. Discussion of the basic problems and gaps in information faced by the consortium in the target issue area.
* Meet with any relevant local, county, or national government officials to inform the discussion and information gathering around the issue, including local chiefs, district officers, security and police, ministries of relevance, members of parliament, representatives of devolved government.

## Step Two: Using our Tools. Collection and development of materials, analysis.

* Information gathering around the topic area. Our team works on developing data and stories on the issue together, using digital OSM mapping, investigative news videos, blog posts and an SMS campaign around the issue using Ushahidi to gather more local input for the campaign.</li> 
* Processing the information:
    * What stands out in our team investigation? Develop key outcomes and create a visual representation.

## Step Three: Reporting back to the Community and developing action plans

* Sharing the results in a forum
    * Confirming accuracy with the community members, making any needed corrections to the maps or narratives and videos.
    * Agreeing on the targets – what do people want to achieve? Specific goals for the short term, and longer term.
    * Agreeing on leadership
* Reporting back to the NGO consortium
    * Agreeing on targets, leadership

## Step Four: Lobbying and Advocacy

* Local Outreach:
    * Painting on walls: information graphs and maps
    * Screenings of the investigative videos
    * Sharing the blog posts and other media through collaboration with local media and events. 
* Media Outreach:
    * Getting the Kenyan media involved: placing key stories in the mainstream media through partnerships with journalists.
* Government Outreach:
    * Consortium representatives along with MK representatives meet with the previously engaged government officials, and present the analysis with data and media backup.

## Step Five: Negotiation: between consortium and government representatives.
* Successful impact on the target goal: specific result for the community.
